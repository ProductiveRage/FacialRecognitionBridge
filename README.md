# Facial Detection Experiment (Bridge.NET port)

This is a port of my .NET [Face Detection](https://github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition) toy project to [Bridge.NET](http://bridge.net/), so that the code may run in the browser.

It includes a fraction of the [Accord.NET](https://github.com/accord-net/framework) library, also compiled with Bridge.NET (so that I have access to a support vector machine for classifying "possible face regions").

For more details about this project, refer to the [.NET version](https://github.com/ProductiveRage/FacialRecognition) or my blog post about it: "[Face or no face (finding faces in photos using C# and Accord.NET)](http://www.productiverage.com/face-or-no-face-finding-faces-in-photos-using-c-sharp-and-accordnet)".
